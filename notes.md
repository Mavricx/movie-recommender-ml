# Types of Recommender Systems

Recommender systems are tools designed to suggest items to users based on various algorithms. Here are the main types:

1. **Content-Based**  
    These systems recommend items similar to those the user has interacted with in the past by analyzing item features.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**  
    This approach relies on user interactions and preferences, identifying patterns among users to make recommendations.

3. **Hybrid**  
    Combines content-based and collaborative filtering methods to leverage the strengths of both approaches.

    ## Project Flow

    The typical flow of a recommender system project involves the following steps:

    1. **Data Collection**  
        Gather relevant data for building the recommender system.

    2. **Preprocessing**  
        Clean and prepare the data for analysis and modeling.

    3. **Model Development**  
        Build and train the recommender system model.

    4. **Website Integration**  
        Integrate the model into a user-facing website or application.

    5. **Deployment**  
        Deploy the system to a production environment for real-world use.
